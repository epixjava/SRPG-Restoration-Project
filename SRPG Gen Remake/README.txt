## INTRO!
// SRPG Mega Drive decomp? port? remake? by epixjava - 2024
// tried to recreate the game by comparing to z80 source and playable OG version on emulator. 
// I will translate to English at some point. Should be easy. 
// My version does not scroll each screen, it CLS(clears screen) OG version scrolls. 
// I have not been able to figure out how to do that. 99% done otherwise as far as I can tell. 


## INFO!
// SRPG.bex is WIP. You need to edit this game in basiegaxorz with ASMX assembler. 
// I will do a more detailed write up on this project once it is complete. 
// Tools folder will have useful stuff. 
// Compiled rom runs in emulator. 
// I have not tried to run the game on actual hardware, 
// if I do try, will probably be on a Analogue Mega SG. I don't have a Genesis evderive :(

// Enjoy!

# SRPG-Decomp-Project
SRPG Decomp Project for sega genesis 

This is a passion project that I started about a year ago. I read online that the Gamecube version of the homebrew game Sonic RPG was missing.
The Megadrive version of the game existed online but in french. I saw this as a good opertunity to learn more about 68k assembly and device hardware. 
The goal of this project is to take this version of the game, translate it and then recompile into code for the Gamecube, restoring that lost software. 
I want to keep as much of the core game as possible, including bugs. 
Eventually I will try to flesh out the game more and make edits and improvments but this is a stretch goal and will be listed as a seperate project from the orginal. 
I dont think anyone is asking for this but I have always loved Sonic in all his forms so I push on...slowly
